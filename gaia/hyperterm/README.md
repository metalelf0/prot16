# DEPRECATED Gaia theme (dark variant)

*Gaia* is a low-to-medium contrast theme that delivers an earthly feel.

Install it by adding `hyperterm-gaia-dark` to the plugins list in `~/.hyperterm.js`.

*Gaia* was originally developed for the Atom text editor. This package is a preliminary port to [HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org/). As of now, it does not use the theme's entire palette.
