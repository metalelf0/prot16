# Prot16

## Colour schemes and syntax themes

This is the master repository of all the colour schemes I have developed. For the time being, you will find the following under each item's directory:

- an SCSS stylesheet that can be used in Jekyll websites;
- a YAML file with the colour values in HEX format;
- ~~a package with the HyperTerm port (where applicable);~~ **DEPRECATED**;
- a short description followed by a link to each theme's project page on my website.

This repository **does not include the Atom editor themes**, as these have their own GitHub repos per item (one for the light and another for the dark version).

For an up-to-date list of the packages I have released, see:

- **My website.** [http://www.protesilaos.com/schemes](http://www.protesilaos.com/schemes).
- **Atom profile.** [https://atom.io/users/protesilaos](https://atom.io/users/protesilaos).

## Choosing a theme

This is up to personal preference. I like them all. That is why I publish them. At any rate, here is a short list with some suggestions to help you get started:

- low contrast
  - Cyprium
  - Playa
- medium contrast
  - Flowerbed
  - Symbiosis
- high contrast
  - Bionis
  - Ficus

## Acknowledgements

I was greatly inspired in my work by Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). My gratitude also extends to Bram de Haan for his [Atelier schemes](http://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/atelier-schemes/) and to Chris Kempson for the original [base16 project](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/). Further thanks to Simurai, whose [DuoTone syntax theme](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax) had provided the starting point for the code structure of the Atom packages.

*The label "Prot16" is a play on my nickname and Chris Kempson's base16.*

## Miscellaneous

As of June 12, 2016, this repository replaces the following three:

- Oliveira - [https://github.com/protesilaos/oliveira](https://github.com/protesilaos/oliveira)
- Blau - [https://github.com/protesilaos/blau](https://github.com/protesilaos/blau)
- Cyprium - [https://github.com/protesilaos/cyprium](https://github.com/protesilaos/cyprium)

These were created at a time when I did not have an overarching plan for my syntax-themes-related work. Their maintenance had to be discontinued, as individual repos are hard to maintain at scale.
