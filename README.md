# Prot16

## Colour schemes and syntax themes

This is the master repo of all the syntax highlighting colour schemes I have developed. **The present repository is a work in progress.** The objective is to populate it with all my work on syntax theming.

For the time being, you will find the following herein:

- an SCSS stylesheet of each theme that can be used in Jekyll websites;
- a YAML file with the colour values in HEX format;
- screenshots of each theme's palette, light and dark variants;
- links to each theme's project page and corresponding Atom package.

For an up-to-date list of the themes I have published, visit [http://www.protesilaos.com/schemes](http://www.protesilaos.com/schemes).

## Acknowledgements

I was greatly inspired in my work by Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). My gratitude also extends to Bram de Haan for his [Atelier schemes](http://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/atelier-schemes/) and to Chris Kempson for the original [base16 project](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/). Further thanks to Simurai, whose [DuoTone syntax theme](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax) has provided the starting point for the actual code structure of the Atom packages.

## Miscellaneous

As of June 12, 2016, this repository replaces the following three:

- Oliveira - [https://github.com/protesilaos/oliveira](https://github.com/protesilaos/oliveira)
- Blau - [https://github.com/protesilaos/blau](https://github.com/protesilaos/blau)
- Cyprium - [https://github.com/protesilaos/cyprium](https://github.com/protesilaos/cyprium)

These were created at a time when I did not have an overarching plan on my syntax-themes-related work. Their maintenance had to be discontinued, as individual repos are hard to maintain at scale.

*The label "Prot16" is a play on my nickname and Chris Kempson's base16.*
