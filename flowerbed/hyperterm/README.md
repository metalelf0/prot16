*Flowerbed* is a medium-to-high contrast theme with vivid colours.

Install it by adding `hyperterm-flowerbed-dark` to the plugins list in `~/.hyperterm.js`.

*Flowerbed* was originally developed for the Atom text editor. This package is a preliminary port to [HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org/). As of now, it does not use the theme's entire palette.
