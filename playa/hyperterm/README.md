# DEPRECATED Playa theme (light variant)

*Playa* is a low-contrast theme that conveys a feeling of summer and seaside.

Install it by adding `hyperterm-playa-light` to the plugins list in `~/.hyperterm.js`.

This package is a preliminary port to [HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org/). As things stand, it does not use the theme's entire palette.
