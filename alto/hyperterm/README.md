# Alto theme (dark variant)

*Alto* is a medium-to-high contrast colour scheme. It has been developed with the intention of appearing generic though not without a personality of its own.

Install it by adding `hyperterm-alto-dark` to the plugins list in `~/.hyperterm.js`.

*Alto* was originally developed for the Atom text editor. This package is a provisional port to [HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org/).
