# Cyprium theme (light variant)

*Cyprium* is a low-contrast colour scheme inspired by the landscapes of Cyprus.

Install it by adding `hyperterm-cyprium-light` to the plugins list in `~/.hyperterm.js`.

*Cyprium* was originally developed for the Atom text editor. This package is a preliminary port to [HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org/). As of now, it does not use the theme's entire palette.
