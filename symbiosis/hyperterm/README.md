# DEPRECATED Symbiosis theme (dark variant)

*Symbiosis* is a medium-to-high contrast theme, loosely inspired by the Metroid video game series.

Install it by adding `hyperterm-symbiosis-dark` to the plugins list in `~/.hyperterm.js`.

*Symbiosis* was originally developed for the Atom text editor. This package is a preliminary port to [HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org/). As of now, it does not use the theme's entire palette.
