# DEPRECATED Blau theme (light variant)

*Blau* is a medium contrast colour scheme inspired by FC Barcelona.

Install it by adding `hyperterm-blau-light` to the plugins list in `~/.hyperterm.js`.

*Blau* was originally developed for the Atom text editor. This package is a preliminary port to [HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org/). As of now, it does not use the theme's entire palette.
