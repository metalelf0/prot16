# Ocarina syntax theme

> It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.

*Ocarina* is a medium contrast colour scheme loosely inspired by *The Legend of Zelda* video game series. It has been created as a tribute to Zelda's 30th anniversary.

The theme's most prevalent colours are variations of green, cyan, orange, yellow, and violet.
