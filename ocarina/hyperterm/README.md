# Ocarina theme (light variant)

*Ocarina* is a medium contrast colour scheme loosely inspired by *The Legend of Zelda* video game series. It has been created as a tribute to Zelda's 30th anniversary.

Install it by adding `hyperterm-ocarina-light` to the plugins list in `~/.hyperterm.js`.

*Ocarina* was originally developed for the Atom text editor. This package is a preliminary port to [HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org/). As of now, it does not use the theme's entire palette.
