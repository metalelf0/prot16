# XFCE4 terminal emulator

**This is experimental. Not all use cases have been checked. Colour mapping may require further refinements. Also note that I have only tested this on my Arch Linux and Linux Mint (17.3, 18.0, 18.1) machines.**

To add a colour scheme to your terminal copy the `.theme` file to `/usr/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes`. The theme will then be available in the Preferences dialog > Colours tab > Presets section.
